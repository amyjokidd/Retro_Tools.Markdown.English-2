# Maintaining a database {#vor1613403601615 .task}

Maintaining a database does not take much work.

## Procedure { .taskbody}

-   If the database crashes, restart it.

-   If the database is slow, tell people not to put so much in it.

-   Try to limit the number of records in your database. Too many records leads to confusion.
